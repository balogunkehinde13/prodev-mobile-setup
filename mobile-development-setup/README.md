### **Challenges and Troubleshooting**

| Date | Challenge/Issue | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Today** | **Initial Research & Setup Planning** | Used **Gemini** to understand **what Expo Go does** and the general **steps for usage** in a React Native project. The information received was instrumental in planning the setup process: <ul><li>**What Expo Go does:** It acts as a sandbox/development client to quickly run and test React Native apps instantly on a device without needing native toolchains (like Xcode/Android Studio).</li><li>**Usage:** Create a project with `npx create-expo-app`, run `npx expo start`, and scan the resulting QR code with the Expo Go mobile app.</li></ul> |
| **Today** | **Downloading the Expo Go App** | **No difficulties** were faced while downloading the app on the physical phone (iOS/Android). The download and installation from the app store were quick and straightforward. |
